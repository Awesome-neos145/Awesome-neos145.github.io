<h1>How to get Personified Fear, Fearful Harmony, or Forbidden Image on your PlayStation 1</h1>
<p>I'm weird. This is exactly why I'm telling you how to do this.</p>
<p>What you'll need:</p>
<h1>CHIPPED CONSOLES</h1>
<li>Modchipped PS1</li>
<p>And either the following:</p>
<li>PC CD-ROM game</li>
<li>PS2 CD-ROM game</li>
<li>Corrupted PS1 game</li>
<h1>NON-CHIPPED CONSOLES</h1>
<li>PS1</li>
<li>Tape / Toothpick</li>
<p>And either the following:</p>
<li>PC CD-ROM game</li>
<li>PS2 CD-ROM game</li>
<li>Corrupted PS1 game</li>
<p>Alright, let's begin with the modchipped PS1 folks, for you that were courageous enough to do it.</p>
<h1>Personified Fear (CHIPPED)</h1>
<p>Either put a PS2 CD-ROM or a corrupted PS1 CD-ROM into the system. It's that easy. (Keep in mind that PS2 CD-ROMS will take significantly longer to load than a corrputed PS1 CD-ROM, since the PS2 CD has more data. I'd go with Half-Life for a 3:30 wait time.)</p>
<h1>Fearful Harmony (CHIPPED)</h1>
<p>First, please check that your chipped console's model number is either "SCPH-5xxx" or "SCPH-1xxx". It will not work if you don't have those numbers.</p>
<p>Just put a PC game in there and boot it up. Wait 30-60 seconds for the song to start after the broken PlayStation logo appears.</p>
<h1>Forbidden Image (CHIPPED)</h1>
<p>Please check that you have model number "SCPH-10x", or models that are not "SCPH-5xxx" or "SCPH-1xxx". This will instead trigger Fearful Harmony otherwise.</p>
<p>Put a PC CD-ROM into the disc drive. The PlayStation logo will break.</p>
<br>
<p>We're now done with the chipped users. For non-chipped users, this will be more difficult.</p>
<h1>Personified Fear (NON-CHIPPED)</h1>
<p>For Phat PS1 users, please place pieces of tape where the 2 drive pegs meet the back buttons on the back of the drive cover.</p>
<p>For slim users, put a toothpick under the eject button and have it press the button under it.</p>
<p>Put a legal PS1 disc into the drive with the lid open, and turn on the PS1.</p>
<p>When the disc speeds up after spinning, immediately place the PS2 CD-ROM or corrupted PS1 CD-ROM in the drive without closing it. (Keep in mind that PS2 CD-ROMS will take significantly longer to load than a corrputed PS1 CD-ROM, since the PS2 CD has more data. I'd go with Half-Life for a 3:30 wait time.)</p>
<h1>Fearful Harmony (NON-CHIPPED)</h1>
<p>Same setup steps as above. Also, make sure you have "SCPH-5xxx" or "SCPH-1xxx", otherwise it will just do Forbidden Image.</p>
<p>When the disc speeds up, take it out and put in the PC CD-ROM game. After the corrupted PlayStation screen appears, wait 30-60 seconds for Fearful Harmony to play.</p>
<h1>Forbidden Image (NON-CHIPPED)</h1>
<p>Do the same setup steps as PFear. Also, make sure you have "SCPH-10x" or "SCPH-9xxx", or this will just go to Fearful Harmony.</p>
<p>When the disc speeds up, take it out and put in the PC CD-ROM game. A corrupted PlayStation screen will appear.</p>
