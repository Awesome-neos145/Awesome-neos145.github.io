 <h1>How to play Roblox on Quest 2!</h1>
 <p>Requirements:</P>
 <li>Meta Quest 2</li>
 <li>Oculus Rift System Software</li>
 <li>Roblox</li>
 <li>A gaming computer</li>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>To get started, install Roblox and install the <a href="https://oculus.com/setup">Oculus Rift System Software</a>.</p>
 <p>With the System Software installed, enable <a href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/connect-link-with-quest-2/">Quest Link</a> in the settings of your Oculus and enable <a href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-rift-s/unknown-sources/">Unknown Sources</a>.</p> 
 <p>Now, go into Quest Link on your Oculus and stay there. You now need to start Roblox (WITH THE OCULUS APP RUNNING ON YOUR COMPUTER MINIMIZED). If you see "Roblox Launcher Beta" on your Quest and then see an hour glass, select a game on your computer. (My preferred VR game is <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4832438542/VR-Hands-v2-8">VR Hands</a>.) If you see Roblox running on your Quest, then you have got it to work!</p>
 
 <b>EDIT: ROBLOX IS NOW OUT ON META QUEST HEADSETS.</b>
