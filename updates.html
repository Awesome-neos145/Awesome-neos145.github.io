<h1>UPDATE 9/7/23</h1>
<p>This is my latest (and first) update for this website! First, I'd like to start with mentioning <a href="https://dc-blog.neocities.org/">Digital Cheese</a> for helping me with all the CSS stuff. I know this is going to be a similar story where people won't stop telling their life stories, but to be honest, it's 9PM at the time I'm writing this, and I want to go to sleep. So, let's start. First off, I edited the stylesheet to center the text and add some background. I also changed the font to Montserrat. I was going to have different colored text, but it was hard to see, so I removed it. I was also planning to add some music, but it was really buggy, so I also disabled it. I also added some embeds. Anyway, that's it for now.</p><br>
<h1>UPDATE 9/17/23</h1>
<p>Ten days later comes another update. Hello again! It's also coincidentally 9PM at the time I'm writing this. So, let's talk embeds. Normally, the embeds would limit to ust the main page. Well, I'm updating embeds with every page! (Except 404, for now) I have also added some theme packs. Be on the lookout for more themepacks coming in the future. I guess this was a short update, but I also guess it covers everything I did. See you until the next update!</p><br>
<h1>UPDATE 6/5/2024</h1>
<p>A kind person named SKCro joined my <a href="https://discord.gg/EKBa7rWH4w">Discord server</a> and gave me some tips to optimize my server. I tried to implement them, but that didn't work out because my CSS was a jumbled mess. I shared it with him and he wrote up a brand new stylesheet so that loading forever isn't an issue. Thank you, SKCro. If you want to see his stuff, here's his pages.
