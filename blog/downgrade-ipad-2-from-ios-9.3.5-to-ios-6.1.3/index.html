<title>How to downgrade an iPad 2 from iOS 9.3.5 to iOS 6.1.3</title>
<h1>How to downgrade an iPad 2 from iOS 9.3.5 to iOS 6.1.3</h1>
<p>To get started, here is what you will need:</p>
<li>iPad 2</li>
<li>Computer running Windows 7 or above</li>
<li>MFI-Certified 30-Pin cable</li>
<li>3uTools v2.52</li>
<li>iTunes</li>
<br>
<br>
<p>Alright, now on to the tutorial. First, you need to download iTunes. You can easily do that by simply clicking <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win64">here.</a><p>
<p>You also need 3uTools, which can be downloaded by clicking <a href="https://d-updater.3u.com/3utools/download/3uTools_v2.52_Setup.exe">here.</a></p>
<p>And just so you know, 3uTools is <strong>completely</strong> safe.
<p>Ok, so now what? Well, you need to jailbreak your iPad 2 first. And to do that, you need to go into 3uTools, click Flash and JB, Jailbreak, and click "Start Jailbreak". (If you are on Windows 10+, you need to go into Windows Security, Virus and threat protection, Manage settings, and turn off Real Time Protection. This is crucial for the Jailbreak. Windows will come out with an oh-so-scary false positive if you don't and the JB will fail.)</p>
<p>Once it is done, you need to go into your iOS Settings, General, Device Management, Your Apple ID E-mail, and click trust.</p>
<p>Open up Phoenix and click prepare jailbreak. If it asks you if you want a free mixtape, yadayadayada, just decline it. Click the buttons to proceed. When you see something about 9.3.5 presets, use them. And 1-2-3, your iPad 2 is jailbroken!</p>
<p>When you boot back into your system, you will see a new app called "Cydia". Open Cydia. If the app crashes, reopen Cydia. When you get through all the prompts, click sources, and click add. You want to type in "http://repo.tihmstar.net". When all that is done, click the search button and type in "kDFUapp". You need this, as you need to boot into pwned DFU mode into it to downgrade it.</p>
<p>You need to download an OTA 6.1.3 ipsw file, also. Click <a href="http://d.updater.3u.com/3utools/configs/ota613/ota_iPad2,1.ipsw">here</a> to download it.</p>
<p>Ok, when it is downloaded, open kDFUapp and tick all of the things to on. When you do, a green box should appear saying "enter kDFU". Click on that. The app will say "Entering kDFU mode. Bye bye system..." Don't worry, though. It doesn't erase the system. So if you change your mind, you can exit it by holding the wake/sleep button and the home button at the same time to force shut down the system.</p>
<p>This is where the fun part begins. You want to reopen 3uTools and go to Flash and JB, Pro flash. (If your iPad 2 doesn't appear as connected, you need to replug your device) In pro flash, click "Import Firmware" and choose "ota_iPad2,1.ipsw". Then you click "flash". If you get a popup saying that you are in pwned DFU mode, <strong>ignore the message and do NOT get into normal DFU mode, as it will not work.</strong> You will see a bunch of scary stuff, but it is flashing the device. So there's no need to worry.</p>
<p>If you see a glossy apple logo with a long progress bar, you've done it right! If nothing is popping up on your iPad 2 or there is an error on 3uTools, you need to redo the steps again. (Except downloading and jailbreaking. That's not necessary.)</p>
